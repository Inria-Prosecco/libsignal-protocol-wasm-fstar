How to run the WASM output of KreMLin?

# With v8, from the console

Install and build Google's v8 engine, which should give a d8 binary. Then:

    d8 --allow-natives-syntax main.js

Note: on my machine, it's better to call d8 through an absolute path.

# With Chakra, from the console

Install and build ChakraCore, which should give a ch binary. Then:

    ch -Wasm main.js

# With Chrome, from the browser

Chrome won't run this from the file:// URL, so you'll need to start an HTTP
server from this directory. If you don't have one already:

    npm install http-server

Then, run `http-server .` and navigate to http://localhost:8080/main.html
